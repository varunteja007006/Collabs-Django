# How to Run the Project
Root folder - manage.py has to be run with python

Commands:

> python manage.py make migrations

> python manage.py migrate

> python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb

> python manage.py runserver

Any errors like cannot import so and so module?? then install that module via pip

You can check the Budget.pdf for more info on how the app looks.

Thank you
